# IAmFit4
I am fit app.
This app was made as a part of the under grad course on Object oriented programming.
It is an app which is mainly targeted for the elderly people on our socity suffering from different health issues. It has features like tracking step counts using mobile's accelerometer, reminder for medicine and keeping a track of all the
medicines that one has taken and has yet to take, finding doctors around oneself based on theire geo location and finding the specailaized doctor which is the closest.It has a moderator feature who
can keep track of these features for one. Still some features like medical history, doctor visitation etc have to be added soon.
